### Reddit

#### Software Engineer, Feb 2023 - Dev 2023

<br />
I worked as a contractor at Reddit, specifically under the Ads Growth team managed
by [Qasim Zeeshan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/qasimzeeshan/). My time at Reddit
was a significant milestone in my career as I had the opportunity to collaborate
with highly skilled developers and work on a large-scale codebase. During my time
there, I also developed features that were used by hundreds of thousands to millions
of users.
<br />
- I Engineered intricate UIs with React, Lit, and Internal web frameworks while ensuring
robust code coverage through testing. - The collaborative efforts of my team led
to a 50% increase in monthly advertisers. - Monitored user events using Grafana,
ensuring the products were within SLA requirements. - Implemented features such as
Community Suggestions, Bidless Ads, and Boost Posts.

### Openspec

#### Full stack developer, April 2022 - Jan 2023

<br />
Openspec is a startup that was established to assist product managers in utilizing
AI to map out their product requirements and user stories. As one of the first engineers
of Openspec, I had the privilege of working closely with the CTO, [Rei Shapira](https://www.linkedin.com/in/reishapira/).
It was an enjoyable project, where I created a custom WYSIWYG text editor that utilized
React and [TipTap](https://tiptap.dev/product/editor). I developed custom block and
inline nodes, which gave it a Notion-like experience.
<br />
- I built a custom WYSIWYG text editor using React and TipTap which led to building
custom nodes and extensions. - I achieved a 2 times performance boost through global
state management optimization. - Integrated Github Actions routines to detect errors
and prevent the merging of suboptimal code. - Ensured high-quality development practices
through code reviews and provided transparent project insights with comprehensive
documentation.

### Brimble

#### Frontend Developer, Sept 2020 - Feb 2022

<br />
Brimble was my first remote job. It is a platform for deploying frontend applications.
I got this job when the CTO stumbled across an article I wrote titled ["Ultimate
Guide to Setup React Context API with a Custom Hook [TypeScript]."](https://dev.to/damiisdandy/ultimate-guide-to-setup-react-context-api-with-a-custom-hook-typescript-27kn)
He was researching on the topic when he stumbled across my profile, and then he reached
out to me.
<br />
- Spearheaded the revamp of the website migrating from Vue to React. - I converted
the web app into PWA (Progressive Web Application), which improved load times and
SEO. - Implemented user-requested features based on interviews, showcasing a user-centric
development approach. - Published 5+ technical articles discussing concepts in React
and tutorials.

### Jetron Ticket
I built this platform not only because I noticed a gap in the event space within Nigeria but also to learn how to build
complex systems that scale, handling all aspects from front-end and back-end to its
Continuous integration and deployment. Currently Jetron Ticket has over 30,000 users
and has handled over 350 events.
<br />
- Led a team of developers, implemented CI/CD with tools like Docker, GitHub Actions,
Circle CI, and Digital Ocean. - Built backend services with a payment gateway for
online event ticket payments, designed for Nigerian youths to discover and host events.
- Leveraged external APIs, such as Google Maps and Uber's, to improve the user experience.
- Maintained a mono-repo using [Turbo repo](https://turbo.build/repo) as a source
of truth for the design system. - Used [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) for
storing and fetching images, dynamically fetching images of different sizes to aid
website load time. - Performed unit and end-to-end tests to ensure code maintainability
and integrity, as well as A/B testing for customer feedback. - Used Chart.js to map
out analytics and graphs to render customer data and export data as CSV and xlsx.
