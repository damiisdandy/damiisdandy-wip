## Question
Design an algorithm to encode a list of strings to a single string. The encoded string is then decoded back to the original list of strings.
<br/>
Please implement `encode` and `decode`

#### Example 1:
Input: `["neet","code","love","you"]`<br/>
Output: `["neet","code","love","you"]`

#### Example 2:
Input: `["we","say",":","yes"]`<br/>
Output: `["we","say",":","yes"]`

#### Constraints:
- `0 <= strs.length < 100`
- `0 <= strs[i].length < 200`
- `strs[i]` contains only UTF-8 characters.
