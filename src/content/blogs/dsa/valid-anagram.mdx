## Question
Given two strings s and t, return true if t is an anagram of s, and false otherwise.
<br/>
An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

#### Example 1:
Input: `s = "anagram", t = "nagaram"`<br/>
Output: `true`

#### Example 2:
Input: `s = "rat", t = "car"`<br/>
Output: `false`

#### Constraints:
- `1 <= s.length, t.length <= 5 * 104`
- `s and t consist of lowercase English letters.`
