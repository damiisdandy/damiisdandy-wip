## Question
Given an array of strings `strs`, group the anagrams together. You can return the answer in any order.
<br/>
An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

#### Example 1:
Input: `strs = ["eat","tea","tan","ate","nat","bat"]` <br/>
Output: `[["bat"],["nat","tan"],["ate","eat","tea"]]`

#### Example 2:
Input: `strs = [""]` <br/>
Output: `[[""]]`

#### Example 3:
Input: `strs = ["a"]` <br/>
Output: `[["a"]]`

#### Constraints:
- `1 <= strs.length <= 104`
- `0 <= strs[i].length <= 100`
- `strs[i]` consists of lowercase English letters.
