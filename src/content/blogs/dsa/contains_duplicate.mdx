## Question
Given an integer array `nums`, return `true` if any value appears at least twice in the array, and return `false` if every element is distinct.

#### Example 1:

Input: `nums = [1,2,3,1]`<br/>
Output: `true`

#### Example 2:
Input: `nums = [1,2,3,4]`<br/>
Output: `false`

#### Example 3:
Input: `nums = [1,1,1,3,3,4,3,2,4,2]`<br/>
Output: `true`


#### Constraints:
- `1 <= nums.length <= 105`
- `-109 <= nums[i] <= 109`

## Solution
The main trick to this is to store elements we've seen, then check if it has previously been seen. For this implementation a lookup needs to be done.
We can perform lookup on `hashmaps` with `O(1)`, so we use a `hashmap`, `hashset` or `set` to store previously seen elements for quick lookups.

```python
from typing import List

def containsDuplicate(nums: List[int]) -> bool:
    # set to store previously seen elements
    nums_set = set()
    for num in nums:
        # if we've come across this value return
        if num in nums_set:
            return True
        # else add it to the set
        nums_set.add(num)
    # if we've gone through the list and see nothing, return `False`
    return False
```
